# 7CCSMSDV Introduction to Data Visualization 22/23

This project was initially created in an online web editor CodePen. You can run this project by either visiting 
the link provided (URL: [https://codepen.io/zihao-you/pen/abRzBLN](https://codepen.io/zihao-you/pen/abRzBLN)) or
running the index.html file in this folder directly.

The overall implementation was inspired by one of Johan's works named "Dynamic Grouped Bar Chart with D3.js"
(URL: [https://codepen.io/Rastikko/pen/GqNbqM](https://codepen.io/Rastikko/pen/GqNbqM)), the data 
and some visualisation aspects have been edited to fit into the research context via responding to the first research
question (i.e. Analyse the development of cost-of-living over time. Are there any detectable trends?).
