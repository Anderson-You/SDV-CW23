# 7CCSMSDV Introduction to Data Visualization 22/23

This project was originally created in an online web editor CodePen and you can run it by either following the link 
provided (URL: [https://codepen.io/zihao-you/pen/abRzBLN](https://codepen.io/zihao-you/pen/abRzBLN)) or running the 
index.html file in this folder directly.

The overall implementation was inspired by one of the Johan's works named "Dynamic Grouped Bar Chart with D3.js"
(URL: [https://codepen.io/Rastikko/pen/GqNbqM](https://codepen.io/Rastikko/pen/GqNbqM)). The data and some 
visualisation aspects have been edited to fit into the research context via responding to the first research question 
(i.e. Analyse the development of cost-of-living over time. Are there any detectable trends?).
